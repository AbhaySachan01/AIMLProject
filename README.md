ðŸ”Ÿ Week Plan for Superstore Sales Analyser (Time Series)
# ðŸ”¹ Week 1: Define the Problem & Collect Data
Problem Statement: Predict future sales trends, identify seasonal patterns, and optimize inventory planning.
Dataset Sources:
Kaggle: "Superstore Sales" dataset
Google Trends, Store APIs, or synthetic data
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy
# ðŸ”¹ Week 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates
Convert date columns to proper datetime format
Aggregate data into daily, weekly, or monthly sales
Normalize & scale data for better model performance
Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
# ðŸ”¹ Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plot sales trends over time using line charts
Check for seasonality, trends, and cycles
Identify correlations between variables (e.g., discounts vs. sales)
Visualizations: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
# ðŸ”¹ Week 4: Feature Engineering & Selection
Create lag features (previous week/month sales)
Extract time-based features (day, month, holiday effects)
Calculate moving averages for trend smoothing
Use autocorrelation (ACF & PACF) analysis
Tools: Scikit-learn, Featuretools
# ðŸ”¹ Week 5: Time Series Modeling (Baseline Models)
Implement traditional models:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
Check model performance using RMSE, MAE, MAPE
Tools: Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
# ðŸ”¹ Week 6: Advanced Machine Learning Models
Train ML models:
Random Forest Regression
XGBoost/LightGBM for time series
Compare performance with baseline models
Tools: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
# ðŸ”¹ Week 7: Deep Learning for Time Series
Build LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU model
Use 1D-CNN for time series forecasting
Fine-tune model hyperparameters
Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
# ðŸ”¹ Week 8: Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
Compare ML, deep learning, and statistical models
Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, Optuna
Implement cross-validation for time series (TimeSeriesSplit)
Tools: Scikit-learn, Optuna, TensorFlow
# ðŸ”¹ Week 9: Deploy the Model
Convert the trained model into a Flask/FastAPI service
Create a dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly Dash) for visualization
Deploy on Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud
Tools: Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker
# ðŸ”¹ Week 10: Final Testing & Project Presentation
Perform real-world testing with unseen data
Optimize performance using automated model retraining
Prepare final presentation with key insights and demo
Deliverables: Jupyter Notebook, Web App, Presentation
ðŸŽ¯ Final Output:
âœ… A fully functional AI-powered sales forecasting tool for superstores
âœ… A dashboard to visualize sales trends and predictions
âœ… Machine learning and deep learning models for forecasting
